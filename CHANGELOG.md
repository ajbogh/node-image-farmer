### v1.2.4

### v1.2.2

- Changed README.md based on fixes from v1.2.1

### v1.2.1

- Fixed the prefix setting so the temp files are written to the correct folder.

### v1.2.0

- Moved the appConfig into a JSON file. Bumped the minor version because it's a semi-breaking change.

### v1.1.0

- Massive refactor of connect-thumbs to use promises, multiple processes, and API changes. 
- Decided to bump the major version to prevent conflicts with older versions of the code.
